# RNAseq-pipeline
Pipeline for processing bulk RNA-seq data from raw .fastq files to read counts.

The pipeline is contained within a single shell script and processes paired-end .fastq files from bulk RNA-sequencing and outputs raw read counts (un-normalized).

# Usage
TODO: add description of shell script usage with flags.
